# Open-source, Arduino-based pneumatic system for Dr. Galie's lab at Rowan University.
### This project is a modified version of the [MillerLab Pneumatic System](https://github.com/MillerLabFTW/OpenSourcePneumaticSystem)

Developed and documented by R.J. Weld and Kishan Patel

## Overview
This is an open-source pneumatic control system utilizing an Arduino UNO and the Python 3 programming language.
Python is used for GUI control which sends signals to the Arduino via serial port. Arduino reads these signals and outputs accordingly for the transducer.

More specifically, Python 3.6.3 was used in the development of this project and is the version that will be outlined for setup within this document.
Other Python 3 subversions will most likely work but have not been tested.
